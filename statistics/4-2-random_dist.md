**Exercise 4-2**

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?


```python
import random

l = []
for x in range(1000):
    r = random.random()
    l.append(r)

pmf_random= thinkstats2.Pmf(l)

thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_random)
thinkplot.Text(.0012,.0012, 'Pmf Plot')
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='numbers', ylabel='pmf')
```

```python
def EvalCdf(sample, x):
    count = 0.0
    for value in sample:
        if value <= x:
            count += 1
    prob = count / len(sample)
    return prob

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(l, label='prglngth')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Text(.1,1.2, 'Cdf Plot')
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='numbers', ylabel='cdf')
```

The distribution of the numbers is uniform. That means every value in the range has the same the same chance of being generated by random.random().
